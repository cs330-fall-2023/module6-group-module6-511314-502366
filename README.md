For the Creative Portion I attempted to implement a raise hand feature. Additionally, you cannot add a room with the same name.

For full disclosure I hope that whoever is grading can be understanding as my partner ditched me last second to finish the group project in a different repo and I was left stranded. I tried to complete as much of the project as I could on my own. I have put 40+ hours into this project, but I just had some sturggles making progress. Thank you.
