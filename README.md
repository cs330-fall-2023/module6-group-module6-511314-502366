For the Creative Portion I implemented a raise hand feature where it appears as a yellow box on the side for a couple of seconds. Side note, you cannot add a room with the same name as a previous room.

For full disclosure I hope that whoever is grading can be understanding as my partner ditched me last second to finish the group project in a different repo and I was left stranded. I tried to complete as much of the project as I could on my own. I have put 40+ hours into this project, but I just had some struggles making progress. Thank you.


-1pt "Create room" window will block part of the chat content, which affects usage

# Regrade
## Request
> I think there was a mistake in the grading repo as I received a minus one mark on the project but my final grade in the books was a 18/50. I would appreciate if the grade could be adjusted to a 49/50 based on the grading branch. Thank you. 

## Response
*I was confused as to why there was such a discrepancy, so I completely regraded the entire assignment. You can see feedback below*

|       5       | Raise hand feature       | This works. I do wish it didn't disappear so soon, but that's a minor thing.                          |
|       0       | Other creative feature   | No other creative feature was implemented and first feature is not large enough to warrant 10 points. |
